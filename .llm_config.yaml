# LLM Configuration File
# This file controls which language models are used by different components
#
# All models are accessed via NewAPI (newapi.tsingyuai.com/v1)
# Supported models: gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5, gpt-5
# Model fallback and retry are handled by NewAPI, not in code

main_agents:
  # Model for all main agents (Manager, Ideation, Experimentation, Writeup)
  # Using gpt-5 as default (stable and cost-effective via NewAPI)
  model: gpt-5

  # GPT-5 specific settings (uncomment if using gpt-5 series)
  # model: gpt-5
  # reasoning_effort: high  # minimal, low, medium, high

  # Claude Extended Thinking settings (optional, only for Claude 4.x models)
  # model: claude-sonnet-4-5
  # budget_tokens: 16384  # Reasoning token budget (min: 1024, recommended: 16k+)

run_experiment_tool:
  # Models for RunExperimentTool (AI-Scientist-v2 subprocess)
  # Using gpt-5 for stability, can upgrade to gpt-5 for better results
  code_model: gpt-5
  feedback_model: gpt-5
  vlm_model: gpt-5
  report_model: gpt-5
  # GPT-5 specific settings (used when code_model is gpt-5)
  reasoning_effort: high  # minimal, low, medium, high
